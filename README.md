# CSCI-213 Lab 10: Working with Git
**Author:** Mack Turner

This is the Git lab for CSCI-213: Object-Oriented Programming. One class was added, Car.java, which extends the abstract Vehicle class. The Car class contains the following:

* two instance variables
* a parameterized constructor for all current and super instance variables
* getters for the instance variables in this class
* the toString method
* the equals method
* a copy method

This project was completed at [Randolph-Macon College](https://www.rmc.edu/).
